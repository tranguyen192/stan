              until deletion is possible.

              your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your
              consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect
              the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal. If you are
              resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are
              unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the

            <h3>8. Data breach</h3>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or
              collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information.
              You will be notified about data breaches when stan believes you
              are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data
              breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm
              to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that stan
              becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may
              result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal
              information stan will promptly investigate the matter and notify
              the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after
              having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is
              unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
              persons.

            <h3> 9. Controls for do-not-track features</h3>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
              applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you
              can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
              about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No
              uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
              signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond
              to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
              communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
              for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
              we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
              this privacy policy.

            <p>
              In Short: Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay
              compliant with relevant laws. We may update this privacy policy
              from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an
              updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective
              as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this
              privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a
              notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.
              We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be
              informed of how we are protecting your information.
